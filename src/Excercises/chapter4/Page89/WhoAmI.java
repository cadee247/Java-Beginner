//Q: A class can have any number of these:
//A: getter, setter, method, instance variable
//Explanation: A class can hold multiple variables and as many methods (including getters/setters) as needed.

//Q: A method can have only one of these:
//A: return
//Explanation: Each method has a single return type and can only return one value at a time.

//Q: This can be implicitly promoted:
//A: argument, return
//Explanation: Java can automatically widen types (e.g., int → double) for both method arguments and return values.

//Q: I prefer my instance variables private:
//A: encapsulation
//Explanation: Encapsulation hides data by keeping fields private and controlling access through methods.

//Q: It really means “make a copy.”
//A: pass by value
//Explanation: Java passes variables by value, meaning methods get a copy, not the original reference.

//Q: Only setters should update these:
//A: instance variables
//Explanation: Setters provide controlled access to modify fields, instead of allowing direct changes.

//Q: A method can have many of these:
//A: argument
//Explanation: Methods can take multiple input parameters separated by commas.

//Q: I return something by definition:
//A: getter
//Explanation: Getters are designed to return the value of an instance variable.

//Q: I shouldn’t be used with instance variables:
//A: public
//Explanation: Public fields break encapsulation by exposing internal data directly.

//Q: I can have many arguments:
//A: method
//Explanation: A method signature can accept several arguments.

//Q: By definition, I take one argument:
//A: setter
//Explanation: A setter typically updates one variable, so it usually takes a single parameter.

//Q: These help create encapsulation:
//A: getter, setter, public, private
//Explanation: Encapsulation is achieved by hiding fields (private) and controlling access with public getters/setters.

//Q: I always fly solo:
//A: return
//Explanation: A method can only return one value at a time.
