//I suspected that the problem wasn’t with Buchanan’s methods at all,
//but with his instance variables. He bragged about making the critical
//methods private, but he never said a word about the fields themselves.
//If those variables were left public, a hacker wouldn’t even need the
//methods—they could just read or change the data directly.
//That kind of sloppy encapsulation would explain exactly how someone
//got into Leveler’s warehouse data.
