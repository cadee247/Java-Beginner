//output:
//result 543345

//explanations:
//1. Value[] values = new Value[6];
//Explanation: Creates an array of 6 Value objects to store data used later in the loop.

//2. values[i] = new Value();
//Explanation: Instantiates a new Value object at each index so we can set and use its intValue.

//3. values[i].intValue = number;
//Explanation: Assigns the current number to the objectâ€™s field so it can be used in calculations.

//4. i = i + 1;
//Explanation: Moves to the next array index so the loop fills all 6 elements.

//5. i = i - 1;
//Explanation: Counts backwards through the array to process elements from last to first.

//6. result = result + values[i].doStuff(i);
//Explanation: Calls doStuff() for each Value, adds its return value to the running total.

//7. class Value
//Explanation: Defines the Value type used in the array and calculations.

//8. public int doStuff(int factor)
//Explanation: Method returns an int (the calculation), takes one parameter called factor.

//9. factor
//Explanation: Represents the current index passed into doStuff(), used in the math.

//10. return intValue * factor;
//Explanation: If intValue is large, multiply by the index (factor).

//11. return intValue * (5 - factor);
//Explanation: If intValue is small, multiply by a decreasing value to adjust the result.
